Shortscore
====================

Shortscore is intended to be a simple text-based music notation syntax especially created for easy handling of large scores.

The basic priciple is to write one measure at a time vertically. Only parts that actually contain music are included.

See the [example folder](https://github.com/PeterBjuhr/shortscore/tree/master/example) for an example with resulting score.

Presently the shortcode notation is closely associated with LilyPond music notation. And basic import and export functionality is included.
