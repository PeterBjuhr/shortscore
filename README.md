Shortscore
====================

Shortscore is intended to be a simple text-based music notation syntax especially created for easy handling of large scores.

The basic priciple is to write one measure at a time vertically. Only parts that accually contain music are included.

See the example folder for an example with resulting score.

Presently the shortcode notation is closely associated with LilyPond music notation. And basic import and export functionality is included.
